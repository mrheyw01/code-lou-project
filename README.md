This is my final project for Code Louisville's Web Dev 1 course, which is a website for a fictional hot sauce company named KAPF Hot Sauce. It is currently one page, but I plan to expand on this project and make it a larger site in future courses.

The 3 features I've included from the required features list are: 
1) Create a responsive menu with JavaScript
2) Add your own transition animation to an element on hover (seen on the hero CTA button)
3) Create accordion boxes to display different types of info (seen in the final section of the page)

To view this project, you can open my code in VS Code and run on a Live Server.
